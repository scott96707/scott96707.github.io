  My Portfolio
</h1>

Working on my web design and javascript/react skills. This is the second iteration of my page and I'm taking heavy inspiration from LekoArt's template page: https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara/

I'm using the "Development" branch of this repo to store all of my code. I'm using the Master branch for deployments. I'm doing this because Github Pages is obstinant that Master must be where the actual page is generated.
